<h2>Developer</h2>

	<div id="developer">
    <img src="collection/developer.jpg">
   <p> Study and understand whole project under s/he is registered as member.</p>
    <p>She/He should know project details, project planning and project architecture in depth.</p>
    <p>First she/he should read JSP, Database (such as how to insert records in database, update records, and delete records from database).
    Check standard of coding in previous workspace, source code before your development in project.</p>
    <p>This will give you new style of programming. Install web server at developer machine at your home, office or anywhere. Install JDK 1.6 version on your machine. Test any JSP page on your system.
    Start development at your machine, test your code, logging in workspace and put your code with details of your screen with output screen, LIVE.</p>
    <p>Test engineer will test your code and if successfully tested OK. It will be the part of source code in project. Your will get points on inclusion in source code.
    If your code failed in testing by Testing engineer, other developer or other member, it will be published in bug reporting section. You should to read bugs/errors and remove bugs from your code then resubmit your code again in workspace for testing and inclusion in source code section of project.</p>
   </div>
<h2>Testing</h2>
	<div id="testing">
    <img src="collection/testing.jpg">
   <p> Study and understand whole project under s/he is registered as member.</p>
    <p>S/he should know project details, project planning and project architecture in depth.</p>
    <p>First s/he should read about Testing terms, manual testing or automatic testing. Manual testing includes functional testing of the software. Automatic testing needs testing tools, it can be WDST from Microsoft. If you want to do code level testing, you can use JUNIT testing, crotus tools</p>
    <p>Check standard of testing in previous workspace, before start doing testing.
    Download new build of workspace or can cross check previous tested OK build by others in your machine. Test it; provide proof of testing, if successful in your condition what part of you tested, how your test proceeds, what were steps. Screen shot of output and your work.
    If code is failed in your test condition, put the proof of fail in bugs reporting section with details. You will get points on inclusion in test proofing code or reporting bugs.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

    <p>Study and understand whole project under s/he is registered as member.</p>
   <p> S/he should know project details, project planning and project architecture in depth.</p>
