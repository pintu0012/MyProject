<p>"We also have 100% job guarantee program for project training. If students are enrolled for our Job guarantee program, they get the offer letter for job on the first day of training."</p>

<p>We are charging fee for Project training, because we believe if its paid training only then students are serious to do it and only then company is serious to train students. If its free, students enjoy most of time without putting efforts for project, so at the end of the project training the students do not get enough knowledge, so they donâ€™t get good job.</p>
